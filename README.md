# Youtube-API-V3
Simple and Fast script to get all you need from the new Youtube API v3


###### I have been using Youtube API V2 and everything was good, until the new API we had to set two requests to get all details about videos. However calling `Search` and `Video` requests takes time (around 10.2Sec for 50 results #'Huge'#), I had to reduce the time because visitors can't wait all 10 seconds.
